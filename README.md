chem note from smc 

This project is for those who are interesting in chemistry learning 

served as a pre-study material 

You can add or edit if you know further details about one concept listed in "chem note"
(no you can not since I upload it in PDF, You can add further info in describtion) 

Don't take your professor as a reliable source of infomation!!! You should check one infomation from different sources like google can provides you many different sources.

One professor once told he did not believe Lead ion can react with sulfate. But this reaction is vaild, most ICE cars have a lead sulfate battery to start enegine. 

That is the reason I urge you not to take professor as a reliable source, sometimes they don't know what they are talking about.

peace&love
